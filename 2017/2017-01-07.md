## Annotations: Joe Stewart - Maintaining Satisfaction as a Designer

https://creativemornings.com/talks/joe-stewart/2

- Designer is always wrong.
- Design is way of thinking. A media of thinking
- Methology to learn and progress
- One thing that is great:
- Being inspired
```
> The diference between good design and just ok design
> The diference between being happy to work on something and just working
```
- Inspiration is one second: seeing the finish line before you start
- Nobody is good yet in digital.
