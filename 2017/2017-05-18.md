## Note: My thoughts about usability tests

This note was written today after a usability test, remembering the other ten tests I have participated too.

 - The people need to feel the scenario is real. So, use real data. Mock the name, email and the scenario for each person. It's like poker if you don't play with real values the game doesn't work.
 - If you went to a test trying to make a score. You are in the wrong mindset.
 - Never start taking conclusion after watching one test session. Record, make notes, store data. Tests are about found behavior patterns.
