`hamlet` `data tables` `books`

- [Data tables alignments](https://medium.com/mission-log/design-better-data-tables-430a30a00d8c#.f6fgqu6sa):
```
1. Numerical data is right-aligned
2. Textual data is left-aligned
3. Headers are aligned with their data
3½. Don’t use center alignment.
```
- Listening Karnal, I write down this definition of what is a Classic book: Is a book you can re-visited. It is a partner for entire life each phase of your life you read with a different look. Classics needs to be respected.
- Hamlet is the first modern man. The owner of you destiny he understands the human consciences are alone. The wise knows you are enough for yourself. Don't need the other to confirm who you are.
