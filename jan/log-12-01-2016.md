`git` `terminal` 

## Learn

- In Unix systems, one dash is the "short option"; two dashes specifies "long option" or verbose.
- Computer date systems have a problem: The time for it have a begin [1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in an end [2038](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem). The Unix Millennium Bug
- [January 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_0) is an alternative name for December 31. WTF?
- Today at D3 we have a great workshop about `git` with [@victorgama](https://github.com/victorgama). I could learn some dirty tricks:

Interactive rebase <3
```git 
rebase -i <commit-hash>
#pick commit is included
#fixup: merged has its message discarde
```

Create a branch from commit-hash
```git 
git branch <commit-hash>
```

`Grep` + `awk` to filter the output and use with `xargs` to another command.
```git
git fsck --full --lost-found | grep commit | awk '{ print $3 }' | xargs git show
```

If you don't want commit ever change made in a file. Use the choose hunks.
```git
git add -p entry_point.py
```

It's possible to apply diff files in git repository.
```git
git diff > ~/test.diff
git apply ~/test.diff
```

Be a git chirurgeon with `cherry pick`. Apply an existing commit ahead.
```git 
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```
