## Learn

- Excellent text about the internet landscape. The timeline and the rumble of companies to imitate the web environment where everyone would access: http://petergasston.co.uk/surveying-the-landscape/
- Writing good dialogues in fiction, it’s necessary to know the characters intention. People don’t say what they want but talking like foolish around that.
- Joel Spolsky resumes the [history of Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z8OSr2_W2Q) in six phases: Archaic, Magic, Impulsive (management needs show power), Conformist, Achievement (Management by objectives for a superior people) and Pluralistic (everyone was stakeholders).
- Illustrator saves complex SVG gradients as an image embed in an SVG file. To avoid that: save the path in with no presentation style and manually apply SVG Gradient with `fill: filter()`:
```html
<svg width=“500” height=“300”>
  <defs>
    <linearGradient id=“linear” x1=“0%” y1=“0%” x2=“100%” y2=“0%”>
      <stop offset=“0%”   stop-color=“#000”/>
			<stop offset=“50%” stop-color=“#ddd”/>
      <stop offset=“100%” stop-color=“#fff”/>
    </linearGradient>
  </defs>

  <rect x=“10” y=“10” width=“500” height=“300” fill=“url(#linear)” />
</svg>
```
- Moving the href attribute to the beginning of an element improves compression when GZIP is enabled, because the href attribute is used in a, base and link tags.
