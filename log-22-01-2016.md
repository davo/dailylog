 `js` `const` `machine learning`

- I start studying machine learning and prediction APIs. The Google API is a black box but easy to use and get good results. [Like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M19TDWhxYr0). 
- "I use `const` by default, `let` only where it is required and `var` to identify code which needs to be refactored." https://ada.is/blog/2015/07/13/immutable/
- Template string and `concat` function to string concatenation.
```js
`My name is ${firstName} ${lastName}`

var result = ''.concat(1, 2, 3); //"123"
```
